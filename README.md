I was just trying to explore ArcGIS API for JavaScript, so I made this simple code which is briefly:
- A Map containing a symbology for each city upon it's Population.
- Select box to change the baseMap.
- Select box to change the category of the place you are looking for, once you click wherever you want in the Map you will get the nearest 20 place of the selected category.
